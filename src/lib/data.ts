      "A geocache is typically a small waterproof container with a notebook/piece of paper inside it for finders to sign and date. Sometimes they also contain small trinkets or messages hidden by others - no box is ever the same! Use the Geocaching app to find different geocaching sites near you and discover all sorts of hidden treasures. Once you've reached the location you may need to look hard to find them - many are hidden in trees or between rocks. Don't forget to sign your name and put the date.",
